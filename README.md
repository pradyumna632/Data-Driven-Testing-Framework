# Data-Driven Testing Framework

This repository contains a Data-Driven Testing Framework developed in Java for testing web applications. The framework is designed to automate test scenarios using Selenium WebDriver, Apache POI for Excel file handling, TestNG for test execution, and Maven for project management.

## Features

- Utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for enhanced code organization and maintainability.
- Implements Data-Driven Testing by integrating Excel files as the primary data source for test cases.
- Uses annotations like @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, and @DataProvider for streamlined test execution.
- Supports testing of various modules, with the Login Page module as a demonstration.
- Provides flexibility and scalability for adding new test cases and modules.

## Tech Stack

- Selenium WebDriver
- Java
